# HexSoftwares_Project_tic_tac_toe
This is a simple command-line Python game of Tic-Tac-Toe, where you (the user) play against the computer. The computer uses the random module for move selection and includes medium-level AI logic that can block your winning moves, making it more fun and challenging!
